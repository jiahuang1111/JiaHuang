            Debris
        </h1>
           <p>
            We also live in a time in which debris can be considered more historically. The debris of various wars can now be seen through a particular character: shards of wood from cannon warfare, shrapnel half-sinking in the muddy trenches of the First World War, the grey deserts of atomic and incendiary bombs from the Second World War, or piles of twisted rebar and shattered plate glass from the civil wars in the former Yugoslavia. Although unrecognisable as architecture, debris can be revisited as an index of a particular time through its grades and textures.
           </p>It is this historical and material aspect of debris that underpins a recent project by the architects Manuel Herz and Eyal Weizman. For a public park and park buildings in Cologne, Germany, Herz and Weizman developed an architectural, constructional language composed of excavated debris and rubble first buried in the wake of the cityâ€™s bombing during the Second World War. Here soil, rubble and debris are heaped over concrete frameworks with elongated windows (to extend past the angle of repose of the dumped pieces of brick and stone) forming a series of garden pavilions.
           <p>Herz and Weizman propose using this shattered matter as a way to build a future out of a violent past - the debris will eventually be turfed over - creating a site for wild flowers, weeds and plants. Expanding upon the work of the Smithsons, these architects transform debris into a true construction system, but they also provide debris with a historical character and with an implied future quality that connects with, but ultimately extends beyond, debris as register of loss and disaster.</p>
