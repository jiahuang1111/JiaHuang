        <h1>
            Love Among the Ruins
        </h1>
        <p> Despite their irony, Laksa and Grospierre’s images conform to the conventional symbolism of the ruin as a measure of the irresistible passage of time. Broken buildings have drawn the romantic imagination as signs of the triumph of nature over culture: cracks and weeds mark the limits of civilisation and point to man’s hubris.4 Robert Browning’s 1855 poem, ‘Love Amongst the Ruins’, describes an Italian landscape centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire. In a little tower overrun with humble plants, the poet meets his lover:
            
            <p>
            </p>That a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair
            Waits me there
            In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul
            For the goal,
            When the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb
            Till I come.
        </p>Love and nature, according to the poet, will outlive war and martial power. It is, perhaps, rather more difficult to aestheticise the ruins generated by modern warfare than those produced by the passing of time (although some have tried®).
    <p>The ruins which result from mechanised violence seem far less innocent or optimistic or, as Georg Simmel described it, ‘natural’.? As chronometers, they do not measure the slow passing of time but short and explosive events.</p>
